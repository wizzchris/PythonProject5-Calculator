# READ ME file for My.Miyagi
The following code is for a calculator. It has separate file for the functions and allows you to input a list for the calculator to add, subtract, multiply and divide.

## Here I learnt:
-If statements
-While
-Input
-Functions
-The input was also markdown

This also used git and was pushed to git hub
DRY was applied as well to reduce repeated statements
